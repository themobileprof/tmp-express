    summary: Validate a sponsorship discount code
    description: |
      Public endpoint to validate a sponsorship discount code.
      
      **Frontend Integration Flow:**
      1. **User enters discount code** in checkout UI
      2. **Validate code** via this endpoint (no auth required)
      3. **Check validity** using `valid` field and `isExpired`/`isFull` flags
      4. **Extract sponsorship UUID** from `sponsorship.id` (NOT the discount code)
      5. **Proceed to enrollment** using the sponsorship UUID
      
      **Enrollment Flow:**
      - **100% discount**: Use POST `/courses/{courseId}/enroll` with `{ sponsorshipId }`
      - **Partial discount**: Use POST `/payments/initialize` with sponsorship details
      
      **Key Points:**
      - **NEVER send discount codes directly** to enrollment endpoints
      - **ALWAYS validate first** to get the sponsorship UUID
      - **Use sponsorship.id** (UUID), not the discount code string
      - **Check isExpired and isFull** before allowing enrollment
      - **100% discounts** result in immediate free enrollment
      - **Partial discounts** require payment processing
      
      **Error Handling:**
      - Invalid codes: Show error message and disable continue
      - Expired codes: Show "expired" message and disable enrollment
      - Full capacity: Show "full" message and disable enrollment
      - Wrong course: Show "wrong course" message and disable enrollment
