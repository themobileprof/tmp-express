# Admin Setup & Management Guide

This guide covers setting up and managing admin users for TheMobileProf LMS.

## üîß Admin Authentication

### Separate Admin Login
The admin system uses **separate authentication** from regular users:
- **Regular users**: `POST /api/auth/login` (students, instructors, sponsors)
- **Admin users**: `POST /api/auth/admin/login` (admin only)

### No Admin Registration
Admin users **cannot register** through the regular registration endpoint. They must be created manually using the admin creation script.

## üöÄ Creating Admin Users

### Method 1: Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
npm run create-admin
```

This will prompt you for:
- Email address
- Password (minimum 8 characters)
- First name
- Last name

### Method 2: Command Line Arguments
```bash
npm run create-admin admin@themobileprof.com securepassword123 "Admin" "User"
```

### Method 3: Direct Script Execution
```bash
node scripts/create-admin.js admin@themobileprof.com securepassword123 "Admin" "User"
```

## üîê Admin Login

### Local Authentication
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.themobileprof.com/api/auth/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@themobileprof.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }'
```

### Google OAuth (if configured)
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.themobileprof.com/api/auth/admin/google \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token": "google_oauth_token"
  }'
```

### Database Commands
```sql
-- Check existing admin users
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, is_active FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';

-- Create admin user directly (emergency only)
INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, role, auth_provider, email_verified, is_active)
VALUES ('emergency@themobileprof.com', 'hashed_password', 'Emergency', 'Admin', 'admin', 'local', true, true);

-- Reset admin password
UPDATE users 
SET password_hash = 'new_hashed_password', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
WHERE email = 'admin@themobileprof.com' AND role = 'admin';
```

## üìù Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file for admin functionality:

```env

## üìû Support

For admin-related issues:
