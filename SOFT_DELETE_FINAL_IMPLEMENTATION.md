## Database Schema

All 8 tables now have:

```sql
ALTER TABLE {table_name} ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_{table_name}_deleted_at ON {table_name}(deleted_at) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

**Tables with soft delete**:
1. courses
2. classes
3. sponsorships
4. lessons
5. tests
6. discussions
7. sponsorship_opportunities
8. certification_programs (schema ready, no endpoints yet)

## API Pattern

### Soft Delete (Default)
```http
DELETE /api/{resource}/:id
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Resource soft deleted successfully",
  "note": "Resource is hidden but related data preserved. Use restore endpoint to recover.",
  "deletedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Permanent Delete
```http
DELETE /api/{resource}/:id?permanent=true
```

**Response** (success):
```json
{
  "message": "Resource permanently deleted",
  "warning": "This action cannot be undone"
}
```

**Response** (has dependencies):
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Cannot permanently delete resource with X dependency(ies).",
    "code": "Resource Has Dependencies",
    "statusCode": 400
  }
}
```

### Restore Deleted
```http
POST /api/{resource}/:id/restore
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Resource restored successfully",
  "resourceId": "uuid-here",
  "resourceTitle": "Resource Name"
}
```

### List Deleted
```http
GET /api/{resource}/deleted/list
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "deletedResources": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "title": "Resource Name",
      "deleted_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      "created_at": "2024-01-10T08:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 5
}
```

## Code Implementation Pattern

### DELETE Endpoint Template

```javascript
router.delete('/:id', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const { permanent } = req.query;

  // Check if resource exists
  const resource = await getRow('SELECT id, title, deleted_at FROM table WHERE id = $1', [id]);
  if (!resource) {
    throw new AppError('Resource not found', 404, 'Resource Not Found');
  }

  // Soft delete (default)
  if (permanent !== 'true') {
    await query(
      'UPDATE table SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = $1',
      [id]
    );
    return res.json({
      message: 'Resource soft deleted successfully',
      note: 'Resource is hidden but data preserved. Use restore endpoint to recover.',
      deletedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }

  // Check dependencies before permanent delete
  const depCount = await getRow('SELECT COUNT(*)::int as count FROM related_table WHERE resource_id = $1', [id]);

  if (depCount.count > 0) {
    throw new AppError(
      `Cannot permanently delete resource with ${depCount.count} dependency(ies).`,
      400,
      'Resource Has Dependencies'
    );
  }

  await query('DELETE FROM table WHERE id = $1', [id]);
  res.json({
    message: 'Resource permanently deleted',
    warning: 'This action cannot be undone'
  });
}));
```

### RESTORE Endpoint Template

```javascript
router.post('/:id/restore', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;

  const resource = await getRow('SELECT id, title, deleted_at FROM table WHERE id = $1', [id]);
  if (!resource) {
    throw new AppError('Resource not found', 404);
  }

  if (!resource.deleted_at) {
    throw new AppError('Resource is not deleted', 400, 'Not Deleted');
  }

  await query('UPDATE table SET deleted_at = NULL WHERE id = $1', [id]);

  res.json({
    message: 'Resource restored successfully',
    resourceId: id,
    resourceTitle: resource.title
  });
}));
```

### LIST DELETED Endpoint Template

```javascript
router.get('/deleted/list', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const deletedResources = await query(`
    SELECT t.id, t.title, t.deleted_at, t.created_at
    FROM table t
    WHERE t.deleted_at IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY t.deleted_at DESC
  `);

  res.json({
    deletedResources: deletedResources.rows,
    count: deletedResources.rows.length
  });
}));
```

### Query Filter Pattern

**Before** (shows all including deleted):
```javascript
const resource = await getRow('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $1', [id]);
```

**After** (hides deleted):
```javascript
const resource = await getRow('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $1 AND deleted_at IS NULL', [id]);
```

**List queries**:
```javascript
// Before
WHERE 1=1

// After
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

## Dependency Checks by Resource

### Sponsorships
```javascript
sponsorship_usage    // Usage records by students
payments             // Payment transactions
sponsorship_courses  // Course associations
```

### Lessons
```javascript
lesson_progress      // Student progress tracking
lesson_workshops     // Workshop sessions
tests                // Associated assessments
```

### Tests
```javascript
test_attempts        // Student test submissions
test_questions       // Test question bank
```

### Discussions
```javascript
discussion_replies   // Thread responses
discussion_likes     // User engagement

## Testing Guide

### 1. Test Soft Delete
```bash
# Delete resource (soft)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/admin/lessons/LESSON_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# Verify hidden from listings
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/lessons

# Verify shows in deleted list
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/lessons/deleted/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

### 2. Test Restore
```bash
# Restore soft-deleted resource
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/lessons/LESSON_ID/restore \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# Verify visible in listings again
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/lessons
```

### 3. Test Permanent Delete (with dependencies)
```bash
# Try to permanently delete (should fail if has dependencies)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/lessons/LESSON_ID?permanent=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# Expected: 400 error with dependency count
```

### 4. Test Permanent Delete (clean resource)
```bash
# Create test resource with no dependencies
# Then permanently delete
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/tests/TEST_ID?permanent=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# Expected: 200 success, resource gone forever
```

## Frontend Impact

### URL Changes
❌ **No URL changes required** - All endpoints remain the same

### Response Format Changes

**DELETE responses** now include:
```javascript
{
  message: "...",
  note: "...",           // NEW: Explanation of soft delete
  deletedAt: "..."       // NEW: Timestamp
}
```

**GET responses**:
- Deleted items automatically filtered out
- No change to response structure
- Items simply won't appear in listings

### New Endpoints Available

All resources now have:
- `POST /:id/restore` - Restore deleted items
- `GET /deleted/list` - View deleted items

**Frontend can now implement**:
- "Undo delete" functionality
- Deleted items archive view
- Bulk restore operations

## Certification Programs - TODO

Certification programs have the database schema ready but no delete endpoints exist yet.

**Required Implementation**:

1. Add to `src/routes/certificationPrograms.js` OR `src/routes/admin.js`:
   - DELETE endpoint with soft/permanent logic
   - POST restore endpoint
   - GET deleted list endpoint

2. Update query filters in:
   - GET all programs
   - GET single program
   - Any other queries

3. Dependencies to check:
   - `certification_program_modules`
   - `certification_program_enrollments`
   - `certification_program_completions` (if exists)

**Code Template**:
See `SOFT_DELETE_CODE_SNIPPETS.md` section on Certification Programs (lines 548-588)

2. Implement DELETE/restore/list endpoints
3. Update all query filters
4. Test with dependencies
5. Update OpenAPI documentation

### For Production Deployment
1. Review all changes in staging
2. Test each resource's soft delete functionality
3. Verify frontend still works (URLs unchanged)
4. Update frontend to use new restore/list endpoints
5. Train support team on recovery procedures

### Optional Enhancements
1. Add "Restore all" bulk operation
2. Add auto-purge of old deleted items (e.g., after 30 days)
3. Add deleted_by field to track who deleted
4. Add audit log for delete/restore actions
5. Create admin UI for deleted items management
